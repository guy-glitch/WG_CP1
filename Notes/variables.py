# VL 1st Variable Notes
variable_name = ("Listitem1, listitem2")
#or this for inputs and variables
variable_name = input("question")
# the = sign is the assignment operator
# names must be specific and without spaces use underscores when nessacary
# also no special characters, start with a letter or underscore
# content tells the computer what the key word means
#Declaration is when we give our variable a name saying it exists, and initialization is when we give it an initial value if you donâ€™t know, set it to be an input, or set default value. variable names have to be unique or else it will change the value of the variable instead
#Declare and initialize at the same time, better to do each variable to do on the same line
